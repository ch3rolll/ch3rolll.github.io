## Local convexity

Uses local geometric features. Can be used to segment both ground and objects.


### Definition

In order to increase robustness, we also consider two surfaces si and sj as locally convex, if their normal vectors approximately have the same direction. So in contrast to the common convexity definition as a curve property, Local Convexity refers to a local, pairwise relation.


### Ground-based method

- While these approaches work very well for environments with a level ground plane and vertical wall structures, they are not suitable for reliable detection of sloped objects like vegetation, hills, or curbs as
they often appear in outdoor environments. 
-  Furthermore, a substantial portion of the information available is lost due to the projection. Therefore, these approaches are very well suited to obstacle avoidance in flat areas, but give only very coarse information on object geometry

### Neighborhood Graph Construction

This method aims to turn a scan into an undirected graph.
