## SQL
1. SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options available, making it a safe choice and especially great for complex queries
2.  it can be restrictive. SQL requires that you use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it
3. Columns are pre-fixed. Cannot be modified.
4. data queryed are returned as rows

## NoSQL
1. has dynamic schema for unstructured data, and data is stored in many ways: it can be column-oriented, document-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store. 
2. You can create documents without having to first define their structure
3. Each document can have its own unique structure
4. The syntax can vary from database to database, and
5. You can add fields/columns as you go.
6. The basic unit is grid. You need to take row index, column index to get the value
