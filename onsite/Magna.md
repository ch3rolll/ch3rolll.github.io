# Why Magna?

First of all, Magna is one of the best Tier 1 automotive suppliers. Magna just teamed up with lyft in Autonomous driving, pretty much similiar to MBand Bosch, This cooperation provides a great platform to everyone who would like to work on autonomous driving.

Secondly, and I found two asian faces in main page of Magna Website. They are doing internship in Manga and they are both originally from Mainland China. I was so glad cuz it gurantees good culture when the company cares a lot about interns and would love to help its employees to grow.

## Why Autonomous Driving?

The first reason would be the technolygies are not mature enough so that we have a great opportunity to work on this and make it happen and even make it perfect.

Secondly, I would like to have the cars driving me safely. In the case, the car would be the lyft drivers and I think thats why ride-sharing companies have to do autonomous driving to survive, to keep the market share.

## Why HD Maps?

Cuz HD maps is fosho the best and most robust sensor in the car with longest range if we keep it up-to-date. 
And meanwhile, it is so complaicated that not a single model to fit all seconarios. For example, there are so many different models: 
1. lane-based, road-based. 
2. Do you need different models for highways and urban roads?
3. Vision-based and lidar-based

And there is a lot of new topics for HD Maps as well. How do you fuse the new observations with your old HD map data and eventaully update your map to keep it fresh.
